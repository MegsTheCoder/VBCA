    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <h4>What is Volkssport?</h4>
        <p>"Volkssporting" literally translates as "people's sports".   It all began 50 years ago in Europe where a need was recognized for healthy, organized, non-competitive activities, suitable for people of all ages. Efforts in several communities resulted in the development of local "volkssport" clubs, which sponsored events for walking, cycling, swimming and cross country skiing. The movement grew rapidly, and is stil growing with our groups today!.</p>

      <div class="faq-content">
        <h4>What type of sports does Volkssport participate in?</h4>
        <p>Although volkssporting activities include walking, swimming, cross-country skiing and cycling, walking events are the most popular among volkssporters in BC.  We don't currently have any cross-country skiing events currently scheduled in BC.</P>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <h3>What types of walks do you sponsor?</h3>
        <p>We have two types of of sponsored events: permanent trails and scheduled events.  Permanent Trails (PTs) are self-guided walks/rides that are in place over a fixed period of time at a specific location. PTs are listed under the tab 'Permanent Trails' above. You are welcome to do these walks on your own at any time. In addition, group walks of Permanent Trails occur throughout the year - for more information on dates and times check with the walk contact or on the Club's website. Scheduled Events are also referred to as Map Walks.  We meet at a specified place and start time. Maps and directions are supplied for each participant. The group will start off together and then spread out as participants walk at their own pace. Scheduled Events are listed under the tab 'Calendar of Events' above.  </p>

        <h3>How do I know if the trails are suitable for me?</h3>
        <p>We have a rating system for our trails to help you decide if the trail is suitable for you.  It’s graded by two tiers, the first is rated by its incline, and the second by its terrain.  Our trails go from very little or stair climbing to many steep hills, and from mostly pavement to very difficult terrain.  For more information about our rating system please look under the about section.</p>

      <div class="faq-content">
        <h3>Do I have to be a member?</h3>
        <p>Membership is not required to join us on one of our walks, though it does have its benefits.  When you are a member you get to participate in achievement awards to earn prizes and track your progress. You also have the satisfaction of knowing that you are helping to support the existence of a non-profit organization which brings people together through the love of the outdoors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <h3>What does it mean to be a member?</h3>
        <p>To become a member, you just need to join one of our groups listed under the member page.  Your first five walks are free and then after that it’s only $1-$2 per walk.  Your money helps to keep VBCA running and keeps our club alive.  Once you become a member you can participate in achievement awards and receive a pin, patch, and a certificate of achievement.  You will also make many new walking friends who love walking just as much as you do.</p>
